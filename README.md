# ANKAREF Internship Tasks
## Task 1
  In this task I wrote a simple CLI calculator that works in core Java which can do addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, square root, and power operations.
## Task 2
  In this task I wrote a simple CLI game which is coded in core Java that takes guesses for the random number selected by the program. The user has a number of guesses and a time limit. The program gives strong output whether the user is close or not to the selected number.
## Task 3
  In this task I used Java's stream methods to answer the given questions.
## Task 4
  In this task I used Spring Boot to create a user authentication system using JWT tokens. I also used docker composer to hande the database. I used PostgreSQL as the SQL dialect.
## Task 5
### EXPLANATION
  This task is a website tracking the events in the company with a user authentication system.
### FINISHED PART
  In this task I used Spring Boot in the backend, Angular in the frontend, and PostgreSQL in the database. In Angular I used SCSS as the extention for the CSS and TypeScript. I implemented user authenticaton with the event and category creation and viewing.
User can see all the events and and the close events, they can view the event details and create events. Admins can see the list of users along with the user privileges and they can also add a user and view user details except user password. Users can register in the register page.
### NOT FINISHED PART
  Users cannot login due to an CORS error even though it is implemented in the `securityConfig` file. In the Postman I can login with the created token from the Postman. One other issiue is category creation page didn't implemented due to time limitations, however its backend part is written.
Last part is due to not being able to login I disable some of the `@PreAutherization` to be able to test the functions, and due to this users can also see the **Admin-only** part in the layout. The last issue is that in the dashboard the image suddenly vanished eventhough its link is still working.
## Last Note
  All in all I learned how to develope a website from scratch along with java in 20 work days (4 weeks), an incredible experience for me. There will be more websites which are more proffessional coming to my github page soon. You can check my github page:
